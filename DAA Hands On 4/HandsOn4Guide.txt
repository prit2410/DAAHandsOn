Problem 0
    Implement the Fibonacci sequence

    x = fib(n)

        if n == 0

            return 0

        if n == 1

             return 1

        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

    Debug the code and "step into" the function for fib(5). I want you to step into all recursive calls and list out the the function call stack ex. fib(5) -> fib(4) -> fib(3) ?....  that you observe.

    Note, don't turn on optimization if your programming language allows it.

    Another note make sure to implement the return exactly as

    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) instead of say

    a = fib(n-1)

    b = fib(n-2)

    return a + b

    OR as

    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

    The reason is, I want everyone to have similar results.



    For the following two problems:

    1. Implement the solutions and upload it to github
    Solution: Connected to pydev debugger (build 232.10319.12)
    Call Stack: fib(5) -> fib(4) -> fib(3) -> fib(2) -> fib(1) -> fib(0) -> fib(1) -> fib(2) -> fib(1) -> fib(0) -> fib(3) -> fib(2) -> fib(1) -> fib(0) -> fib(1)

    2. Prove the time complexity of the algorithms
    Solution: For the Fibonacci sequence with this recursive approach, each fib(n) call spawns two recursive calls, leading to a binary tree of depth n.
    Hence, the time complexity is O(2^n) because each level of the recursion tree approximately doubles the number of calls.

    3. Comment on way's you could improve your implementation (you don't need to do it just discuss it)
    Solution: Memoization or Dynamic Programming:
              Storing the results of already computed fib(n) values in an array would reduce the time complexity to O(n).
              This avoids recomputation of the same values and improves performance dramatically.




Problem 1
    Given K sorted arrays of size N each, the task is to merge them all maintaining their sorted order.

    Examples:

    Input: K = 3, N =  4
    array1 = [1,3,5,7]
    array2 = [2,4,6,8]
    array3 = [0,9,10,11]
    Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
    Merged array in a sorted order where every element is greater than the previous element.

    Input: K = 3, N =  3
    array1 = [1,3,7]
    array2 = [2,4,8]
    array3 = [9,10,11]
    Output: [1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,11]
    Merged array in a sorted order where every element is greater than the previous element.

    Solution: mergeSort.py
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]





Problem 2
    Given a sorted array of size N, the task is to remove the duplicate elements from the array.

    Examples:

    Input: array = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
    Output: array= [2]
    Explanation: All the elements are 2, So only keep one instance of 2.

    Input: array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]
    Output: array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    Note, you can't use something like the set container in C++.
    Solution: Problem2.py
    [2]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
