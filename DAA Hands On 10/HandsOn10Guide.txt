Implement and upload your code to GitHub for:

1. "The basic" Binary Search Tree; this is the one that can be unbalanced

2. Red Black Tree

3. AVL Tree

Assume the data is integers and make sure to show tests proving your implementation is correct. Implement all operations (e.g. query, adding, deleting, etc..).
